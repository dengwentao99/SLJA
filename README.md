# Syllogistic Reasoning for Legal Judgment Analysis

Legal judgment assistants are developing fast due to impressive progress of large language models (LLMs). However, people can hardly trust the results generated by a model without reliable analysis of legal judgement. For legal practitioners, it is common practice to utilize syllogistic reasoning to select and evaluate the arguments of the parties as part of the legal decision-making process. We construct and manually correct a syllogistic reasoning dataset for legal judgment analysis in this paper.
